description-short: IBM Makes is a platform for creators throughout IBM to express themselves and the hobbies that enrich their lives, and also bring that creative energy back into their careers.
description-long: With the breadth and depth of the outlets we have, we’re enabling every IBMer to get into any kind of creative endeavor, without judgment or criticism. If you’ve never done printmaking, the Make Lab provides the environment and resources; if you want to do more print design, the Variable magazine gives you that chance; if you want to make a podcast or host a radio show, the Community Radio provides that space and equipment; if you want to get your hands dirty with some analog crafts, Spare Time has you covered. People at IBM are curious, and we’re doing our part to allow that curiosity to blossom.
