description: Join us for an after hours session to learn everything you need to know about screen printing in the Make Lab. We will be coating screens with emulsion, printing artwork onto transparencies, burning the image into the screen, washing out the stencil, mixing ink, prepping our work station, registering the paper, and finally pulling prints. The artwork always varies, so youâ€™ll leave with a one-of-a-kind screen printed poster that you made yourself!
